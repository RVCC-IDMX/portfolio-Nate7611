This is the first project I undertook in Web Dev 2 and it was built with base HTML and CSS. This website was built around the poem "The Lighthouse" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. I'll be honest, one of the reasons I chose this poem is because I had taken some drone photos of a lighthouse recently and wanted to use them. Coming in from Web Dev 1, I found this website pretty easy but it took awhile to relearn some things after the long break.

To start, I had to chose a theme and i've always really liked dark themes so it should be no surprise that I made this website's theme be a dark theme. After that I had to chose some fonts, for the header I tried to stay on theme so I picked one for the header that reminds me of the sea (somehow). After I was done styling I had to make it responsive. In hindsight, I should have started with that, but I managed to get it done. I have to say, despite this website being simple, I really like how it looks.

Overall, I think this project was a great way to come back to Web Dev after a long winter break. It got me used to writing HTML and CSS again and in the process I even learned some new things with responsiveness. You can view this website [here!](https://lighthouse-poem.netlify.app/)
