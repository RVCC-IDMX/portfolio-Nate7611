While I had made [other poem websites before,](/portfolio/2024-03-22-first-poem-website) this was my first attempt at making one using [Open Props.](https://open-props.style/). I started this project off by first choosing a poem that I would want to build this website around. After searching through some poems in the public domain I found the poem "The Star" by Sara Teasdale. Because of the theme of the poem, I decided I wanted to do a dark theme with some blue elements in there. It wasn't that simple though as another thing I did for this first time with this project was have the website change depending on if your system theme was dark or light. While I wanted to have the light theme also fit the poem's theme, I found that without having a dark background it wasn't really possible. Despite this I'm still happy with how it turned out.

Wait, where was I? Oh right, Open Props. Open Props is an "Open source CSS custom properties to help accelerate adaptive and consistent design." This helps web developers speed up development as they can just pull pre defined CSS properties. One of my concerns going into it was I wouldn't have as much input in the design as the I wasn't writing the CSS. And while of course that was somewhat true, it was not nearly as bad as I thought. If I ever felt limited by Open Props (not that often) I could just write my own CSS. I ended up finding it quite time saving, especially some of the things that would take me a lot of time to do like gradients.

Overall, I did enjoy using Open Props and will probably use it again in the future for some other projects, I think overall I still enjoy writing my own CSS but having it as an option to use is great and my stance on writing all CSS myself will probably change after I writing CSS for a few years.
